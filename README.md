# Teeko AI Player

This project is an intelligent AI agent that plays the board game Teeko. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with a depth-limited search and a heuristic evaluation function to make strategic moves against a human player.

[cite_start]This was developed as a project to practice game theory, AI algorithms, and Python software design[cite: 1, 2, 3].

## ðŸŽ® Game Rules

[cite_start]Teeko is a two-player abstract strategy game played on a 5x5 board[cite: 12].

* [cite_start]**Players**: Each player has four markers[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**Drop Phase**: Players take turns placing their four markers on any empty space on the board[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]**Move Phase**: Once all eight markers are on the board, players take turns moving one of their pieces to an adjacent empty space (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Win Conditions**: The first player to achieve one of the following wins the game[cite: 20]:
    * [cite_start]Four markers in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)[cite: 21].
    * [cite_start]Four markers in a 2x2 square[cite: 22].
